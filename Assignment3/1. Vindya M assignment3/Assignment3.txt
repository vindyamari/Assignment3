1)To initialize the GPIO ports on the Raspberry Pi
 we need to first import the Python library,
 the initialize the library and setup pin 8 as an output pin


import RPi.GPIO as GPIO    # Import Raspberry Pi GPIO library
from time import sleep     # Import the sleep function from the time module

GPIO.setwarnings(False)    # Ignore warning for now
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BOARD)   # Use physical pin numbering
GPIO.setup(8, GPIO.OUT, initial=GPIO.LOW)   # Set pin 8 to be an output pin and set initial value to low (off)


2)Next we need to turn the LED on and off in 1 second intervals by setting the output pin to either high (on) or low (off). We do this inside a infinite loop so our program keep executing until we manually stop it.

while True: # Run forever
    GPIO.output(8, GPIO.HIGH) # Turn on
    sleep(1)                  # Sleep for 1 second
    GPIO.output(8, GPIO.LOW)  # Turn off
    sleep(1)                  # Sleep for 1 second


3)Combining the initialization and the blink code should give you the following full Python program

import RPi.GPIO as GPIO # Import Raspberry Pi GPIO library
from time import sleep # Import the sleep function from the time module

GPIO.setwarnings(False) # Ignore warning for now
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BOARD) # Use physical pin numbering
GPIO.setup(8, GPIO.OUT, initial=GPIO.LOW) # Set pin 8 to be an output pin and set initial value to low (off)

while True: # Run forever
 GPIO.output(8, GPIO.HIGH) # Turn on
 sleep(1) # Sleep for 1 second
 GPIO.output(8, GPIO.LOW) # Turn off
 sleep(1) # Sleep for 1 second
